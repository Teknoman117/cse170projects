Lab 01
======

Objectives
----------
 - Write name with OpenGL triangle primitives
 - Include point and line primitives for flair
 - Include some type on animation
 - Include some type of interaction (arrow keys must do something)
 - Developer should have standards

Compilation
-----------
Linux:
 - Type make to compile the application (worked on Manjaro with freeglut3, GLEW, and MESA OpenGL libraries)
 - The makefile will compile all .cpp files in the folder
 - Edit the makefile to change the name of the executable

Windows:
 - Use the visual studio 10 solution in the visualc14 folder
 - Make sure visualc 2015 is installed 
 - To open the project just double click the .sln file

Note:
 - the provided freeglut library is only used in Windows; 
   in Linux the compiler will seek for the header files and 
   libraries in the default development folders
